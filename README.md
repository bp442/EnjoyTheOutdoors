# EnjoyTheOutdoors
YearUp Capstone 2, a project made for us to practice using Javascript along with Bootstrap in order to create a multi page website that allows a user to search through a simple catalogue of National Parks and Mountains.

Functionality of the site includes the use of a filter in order to sort through types or locations for National Parks, as well as a way to look through a list of Mountains to display info for them.

### Home Page
![Home Page](/images/EnjoyTheHomepage.jpg)
The home page is a simple responsive layout with multiple semi-opaque cards so that users can view every image along with the beautiful background to enforce the theme of the website, which is to get people to be interested in National Parks along with their natural landscapes.

### Search Page
![Search Page](/images/EnjoyTheSearch.jpg)
A simple form with a radio button and dropdown list (if necessary) that will display an accordion of Park information that will be assembled using the search options that the user selects (Location, Park Type, or Display All). Upon switching display types, the accordion will be re-made so as to not make an endless list and to keep it organized.

### Mountain Catalogue

A simple display with a card that details the selected mountain with an image and a description of what it is like. Below the description is a small graphic that shows the sunrise and sunset times for that specific mountain on the current day using an API so that the User can see it in case they want to go hiking there.

#### Things I Learned
I learned how to better use Bootstrap and CSS to make a much cleaner design for my website this time around, as my last Capstone was a bit lacking in the visual department in my opinion. For this Capstone, I went more deeply on making sure everything looked nicer, while also making sure my functionality was perfect and running. Along with that, this was the first Capstone where we introduced Javascript into the main components of the page, and I believe that my Javascript skills are much better off in terms of comfortability than my graphical design. Because of that, I justified the increased focus on the visual aspect, as the coding of the functionality was less challenging overall to me than getting everything to look neat and nice.
